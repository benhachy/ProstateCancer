# Prostate Cancer

In this project, a *medical study* made on patients with *prostate cancer* aims to analyze the *correlation* between the prostate tumor volume and a set of *clinical and morphometric variables*. These variables include prostate specific antigens, a biomarker for prostate cancer, and a number of clinical measures (*age, prostate weight*, etc.). The goal is to build a **regression model** to predict the **severity of cancer**, expressed by **logarithm of the tumor volume**.

To visualize our results, we have opted for the **ggplot2** library in **R**.

The code has been written in **R** by a group of three at *ENSIMAG*
