# prostate-cancer

A medical study made on patients with prostate cancer aims to analyze the correlation between the prostate tumor volume and a set of clinical and morphometric variables. These variables include prostate specific antigens, a biomarker for prostate cancer, and a number of clinical measures (age, prostate weight, etc.). The goal of this practical is to build a regression model to predict the severity of cancer, expressed by logarithm of the tumor volume.
